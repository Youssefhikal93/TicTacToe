## Introduction
The **Tic-Tac-Toe Console Application** is a classic two-player game built in C#. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game resets as a draw.

- **Dynamic Game Grid:** Updates the grid display after every move.
- **Win Detection:** Automatically checks for a winner or a draw after every turn.
- **Game Reset:** Automatically resets the grid when a game concludes.
