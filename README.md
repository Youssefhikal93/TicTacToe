Tic-Tac-Toe Console Application
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed in C#. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player achieves a winning combination or the game ends in a draw.

Key Features:
Player vs Player: Two players can compete in real-time by selecting grid positions for their moves.
Winning Conditions: Detects row, column, or diagonal wins for both players.
Draw Detection: Automatically resets the game when no moves are left, and the game ends in a tie.
User-Friendly Interface: The grid is displayed after every move to show the current game state.
This project is a great example of using multidimensional arrays, basic game logic, and input validation in C#.
